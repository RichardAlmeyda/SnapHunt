ðŸ“¸ SnapHunt is a lightweight Python tool for image intelligence gathering (IMGINT). It extracts image metadata (format, size, mode), generates cryptographic hashes (MD5, SHA1, SHA256), fetches system and host information, extracts GPS data (if available) with Google Maps links, retrieves HTTP headers and host info of the image server, and builds direct reverse image search links for Google Lens, Yandex, Bing, TinEye, and SauceNAO. SnapHunt also automatically generates a timestamped report as a .txt file. ![SnapHunt Screenshot](https://i.ibb.co/4ggprtJg/Screenshot-2025-08-14-161205.png) To install, clone the repository with `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/SnapHunt.git`, navigate to the folder `cd SnapHunt`, and install dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`. To use, run `python snaphunt.py path/to/image.png` replacing the path with your image file location. Disclaimer: This tool is for educational and research purposes only.
